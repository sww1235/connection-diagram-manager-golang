# File Formats

All file formats are currently based on YAML, (and inspired by
[WireViz](https://github.com/formatc1702/WireViz)).

Connection Diagram Manager uses a directory structure to represent an
individual project. All YAML files in the `src` subdirectory will be parsed for
any of the following information. It can be all in one file, or split up into
multiple files. There can be multiple instances of each top level directory
which are parsed and combined as much as possible. If there are unique values
that conflict, the user will be notified with the file names and line numbers
that caused the conflict.

In addition, additional files can be specified in the project config
file that can contain a limited subset of top level dictionaries that contain
library type information such as `connector_type`, `equipment_type`, etc.

Due to the support for multiple files, (and also the possibility of
supporting alternate file syntax formats), YAML references are
not used, unlike in WireViz.

Some libraries will be autopopulated with default values when the program
starts. An optional flag, provided either in the project config file, or on the
command line will prevent this and only use the values loaded from files.

On import, all project data will be validated against the library definitions.
If values are found in the project that are not present in the library, the
user will be prompted on load if they want to save the value to the global
library or a local project library, replace the value with one already in the
libraries, ignore the value, or cancel the load. All errors will indicate file
name and line number so the error is easy to fix. If the user elects to save to
either the global or local library, the load process will be paused and the
user prompted for any additional information needed.


## Project Configuration File

This file must be named `cdm_config.yaml` and be in the project `src` or root
directory. If multiple `cdm_config.yaml` files are found, the one in `src` will
be used to avoid conflict with any other config files placed in the root
directory such as for linters or automated processing of some kind.
```yaml
library_files: <list>
no_default_libraries: <bool>
